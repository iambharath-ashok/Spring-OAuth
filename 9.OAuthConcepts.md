#	SECTION 25: OAuth Concepts

-	When we access the secured applications we needs to authenticate and can access the functionalities that we are authorized for
-	When is set of guidelines or protocol that OAuth service provides should follow

-	Authentication
		-	Identifying or Recognizing the app of person for the Resources
		
-	Authorization
		-	Authorizing person or app to perform set of Operations to Resources

## What is OAuth

-	OAuth is a authentication and authorization standard
-	OAuth is a standard that defines Rules that any application can part of federated authentication and delegated authorization
-	User grants access to application to perform actions on behalf of user and application can perform only operation that user has authorized to it
-	Current version of OAuth is 2.0

## What is OAuth?
	
	-	OAuth is a Authentication and Authorization Standard
	-	OAuth supports Federated Authentication and Delegated Authorization are the Standards of OAuth
	-	One application is consuming the service of another Application as part of Authentication and Authorization Process
	-	Like Third Party Application consuming the service of Google Mail for Authentication

-	Federated Authentication
	-	Commenting on article section
	-	We need to login to site to publish comment
	-	We can use Google OAuth to login and article website will get all the details like username and email id 
	-	So that user can publish the comment on the website
	
-	Delegated Authorization
	-	Tax Filling site after filling tax documents will generate bunch of documents
	-	Those documents needs to be saved Google Drive
	-	User can authorize the tax application to save the documents on the drive
	-	Tax application will get the token from Google for only Drive application with particular permissions
	-	Tax application will not get access to Google mail and Google docs
	
## Why OAuth

-	UseCase

	-	Uploading resume to multiple job portals with linkedin
	-	Job portal will redirect to LinkedIn and user will enter the credentials	
	-	Job portal will communicate with LinkedIn and get all the profile information and resume details
	-	Third party applications can steal all the information LinkedIn or facebook
		-	OAuth ensures that Third Party applications can perform only operation that it's authorized for
	-	User can also revoke the authorization and authentication from the third party applications once done
	

##	Advantages of OAuth

	-	Trust
	-	Unlimited Access
	-	Reduces Data Stealing
	- 	Revocation

## When OAuth

-	OAuth is not a simple authentication mechanism
-	OAuth it self uses another web application for authentication
-	OAuth should be used when user is allowed to authenticate with third party application which already registered
-	OAuth is not suitable for Simple Applications

## OAuth WorkFlow

-	Any third party application that wants to use the service of another application should be register with that application
-	For EX: Google is the Service provider and my web application needs to register with that 
-	After registering ... Google will provide unique client token id

-	Getting User Code from Google

	-	Client application will send client id and session state and redirect url to Google API
	
		http://Googleapis.com/oauth?client_id=javaworld&state=123456780&redirect_uri=http://javaworld&state
		
	-	Google will generate the code for the user and redirect it to client application
	-	User Authenticates and Google redirect to javaworld with code 0002222
	
	
-	Getting token from Google
	
	-	Client send one more request to Google with code and Google returns the token 
	
-	Client can make any # of request 

	-	With the token received from the Google, client can make any number of requests
	

	
## OAuth Support

-	There many java frameworks that support OAuth implementation in our application
-   Spring Security for OAuth
-	Apache CXF



##	Google OAuth Playground

-	Google OAuth Playground can be used feel the usage of OAuth
