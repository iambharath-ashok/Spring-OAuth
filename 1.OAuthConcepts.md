#	SECTION 25: OAuth Concepts

-	When we access the secured applications we needs to authenticate and can access the functionalities that we are authorized for
-	When is set of guidelines or protocol that OAuth service provides should follow

-	Authentication
		-	Identifying or Recognizing the app of person for the Resources
		
-	Authorization
		-	Authorizing person or app to perform set of Operations to Resources

## What is OAuth

-	OAuth is a authentication and authorization standard
-	OAuth is a standard that defines Rules that any application can part of federated authentication and delegated authorization
-	User grants access to application to perform actions on behalf of user and application can perform only operation that user has authorized to it
-	Current version of OAuth is 2.0
-	Auth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for token-based authentication and authorization on the Internet.
-	OAuth, which is pronounced "oh-auth," allows an end user's account information to be used by third-party services, such as Facebook, without exposing the user's password. 
-	OAuth acts as an intermediary on behalf of the end user, providing the service with an access token that authorizes specific account information to be shared. The process for obtaining the token is called a flow.

## What is OAuth?
	
	-	OAuth is a Authentication and Authorization Standard
	-	OAuth supports Federated Authentication and Delegated Authorization are the Standards of OAuth
	-	One application is consuming the service of another Application as part of Authentication and Authorization Process
	-	Like Third Party Application consuming the service of Google Mail for Authentication

-	Federated Authentication
	-	Commenting on article section
	-	We need to login to site to publish comment
	-	We can use Google OAuth to login and article website will get all the details like username and email id 
	-	So that user can publish the comment on the website
	
-	Delegated Authorization
	-	Tax Filling site after filling tax documents will generate bunch of documents
	-	Those documents needs to be saved Google Drive
	-	User can authorize the tax application to save the documents on the drive
	-	Tax application will get the token from Google for only Drive application with particular permissions
	-	Tax application will not get access to Google mail and Google docs
	
## Why OAuth

-	UseCase

	-	Uploading resume to multiple job portals with linkedin
	-	Job portal will redirect to LinkedIn and user will enter the credentials	
	-	Job portal will communicate with LinkedIn and get all the profile information and resume details
	-	Third party applications can steal all the information LinkedIn or facebook
		-	OAuth ensures that Third Party applications can perform only operation that it's authorized for
	-	User can also revoke the authorization and authentication from the third party applications once done
	

##	Advantages of OAuth

	-	Trust
	-	Unlimited Access
	-	Reduces Data Stealing
	- 	Revocation

## When OAuth

-	OAuth is not a simple authentication mechanism
-	OAuth it self uses another web application for authentication
-	OAuth should be used when user is allowed to authenticate with third party application which already registered
-	OAuth is not suitable for Simple Applications

## OAuth WorkFlow

-	Any third party application that wants to use the service of another application should be register with that application
-	For EX: Google is the Service provider and my web application needs to register with that 
-	After registering ... Google will provide unique client token id

-	Getting User Code from Google

	-	Client application will send client id and session state and redirect url to Google API
	
		http://Googleapis.com/oauth?client_id=javaworld&state=123456780&redirect_uri=http://javaworld&state
		
	-	Google will generate the code for the user and redirect it to client application
	-	User Authenticates and Google redirect to javaworld with code 0002222
	
	
-	Getting token from Google
	
	-	Client send one more request to Google with code and Google returns the token 
	
-	Client can make any # of request 

	-	With the token received from the Google, client can make any number of requests
	

	
## OAuth Support

-	There many java frameworks that support OAuth implementation in our application
-   Spring Security for OAuth
-	Apache CXF



##	Google OAuth Playground

-	Google OAuth Playground can be used feel the usage of OAuth
